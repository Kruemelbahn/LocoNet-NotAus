# LocoNet-NotAus

LocoNet-NotAus is a simple circut, that sends OPC_GPOFF (0x82) for Power off or OPC_GPON (0x83) for Power on to stop or (re)start LocoNet-Traffic.<br>
Remark: if the RailSync is (also) powered off, the circuit has no powersupply and cannot work...

The current status is displayed with two addtitional LEDs.

This (my) version was adapted to compile with Arduino-IDE for Arduino-UNO.
Fuses has to be set as follows: lfuse = 0xFF; hfuse = 0xDE; efuse = 0xFD
